# Encrypt-Decrypt

## Project Overview

This project, "Encrypt-Decrypt," is an activity designed for practicing fundamental encryption and decryption logic using the Python programming language. It serves as a hands-on exercise to understand how data can be secured and restored through cryptographic principles.

## Features

* **Encryption Logic:** Implements basic encryption algorithms (details to be filled in by the user).
* **Decryption Logic:** Provides corresponding decryption functionalities to revert encrypted data to its original form.
* **Python-based:** Developed entirely in Python, making it accessible for learning and experimentation in the language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* Visual Studio Code (or any preferred Python IDE/editor).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/jus-tin-16/Encrypt-Decrypt.git](https://github.com/jus-tin-16/Encrypt-Decrypt.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Encrypt-Decrypt
    ```
3.  **(Optional) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies (if any):**
    If your project has a `requirements.txt` file, install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography # alternatively => pip3 install cryptography
    ```
    (If there are no specific external libraries, this step can be skipped.)

## Usage

To use this project, follow the instructions below.

1. Open VSCode
2. **Run the Program**
   ```bash
   py main.py
or simply click the "play" button you can see in the IDE.
